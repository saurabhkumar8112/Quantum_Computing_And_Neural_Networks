# Quantum_Computing_And_Neural_Networks
This repository contains all the papers I have read about Quantum Neural Networks and which made me familiarize with the topic.
I would anyone who is interest in this field to follow the order of papers I have read.

Before that a primary pre-requisite of getting started with Quantum Neural Networks is basic familiarity with Quantum Computations, QuBits, Hilbert spaces, entaglement and some basic quantum gate operations. For that I would highly recommend to watch the 22 tutorial series of Michael Neilson.
